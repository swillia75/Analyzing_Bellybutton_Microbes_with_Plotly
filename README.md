The task is to build an interactive dashboard using Belly Button Diversity data to visualize 
the microbial content of individual’s navel area. The microbes are identified as OTUs (operational 
taxonomic units). The dashboard includes a histogram, gauge chart, and a bubble chart. A dropdown 
is added and each chart changes with each selection.
